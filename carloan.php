  <p><li><h3>Car loan is a financial assistance taken to purchase a car with minimal initial payment from your own pocket. The borrowed money from the lender can be repaid in equal monthly instalments over a period of time with an agreed rate of interest. Normally, car loans are secured with the vehicle itself that is being bought.</h3></li></p>
  <p><li><h3>If you need your car loan account number, you can usually look at your online statement or a paper statement. Typically, it's listed on there. If not, contact your bank. They should be able to provide you with the information if you can verify your identity.</p></li></h3>
